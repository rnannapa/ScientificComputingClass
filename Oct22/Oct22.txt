bmath compile needs 3 arguments.Names to binary array. Bs> binary size, Ba> binary array.
{<name> <float or int> <value>}

NOTE: 1.0 is not a valid TCL name

{1.0 f 1_0}
{2 n 2} > assigns $2 a value of integer 2

No cosines and sines in assembly. Branch to functions.

$argc >> how many command line arguments that are available does not include the script name like in C.

$argv0 >> Script name in TCL

$argv >> 

In tcl every internal variable is a string.

Take the incomplete TCL script and complete the TCL code.

keep usepackage at the top. (Make sure to check for size=0 and size<0). Name a2.tcl. 

Do this loop:

for( i = 0; i <= *size; i++ ) {
    theta = i*dtheta;
    *ptr++ = cos(theta);
    *ptr++ = sin(theta);
  }
