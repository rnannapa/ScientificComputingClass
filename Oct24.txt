Ex1: Allocate memory in C and use in fortran

All variables in fortran are local variables.

	ialloc.c file
run gcc -c ialloc.c to get ialloc.o

gfortran test_ialloc.f ialloc.o  << Linking


Fortran strips the spaces and compiles.

varies from compiler to compiler
#define <IALLOC> <ialloc_> to change it everywhere

to debug use GDB <CHECK FOR THE COMMAND>

No modification in c compiler

Everything in fortran is passed as a pointer/address

Fortran arrays starts at whereever we intend to 

a(0:0) array with one word with 0to0.

ioff >> offset

integrer*8 for 8 bytes

10 4 byte words and divide by 4

======================================================================
Ex: 2
Reciprocal

Newtons Method:
x(n+1) = x(n) - [f(x(n))/f'(x(n))]


Fortran implicit datatypes

variable names starts from a-h o-z are floats unless specified otherwise and i-n by default are integers

implicit none makes it more regerous by making user give datatypes
