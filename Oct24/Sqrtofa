Sqrt of a;
a should be positive
f(x) = x^2 - a

x(n+1) = x(n) - f(x)/f'(x)
	   = 0.5x + a/(2x)

f(x) = 1/x^2 
x(n+1) = x

scale (a) such that a is in between 1-4

Fortran passes by address, use * (pointer)

move pointers and NOT DATA!!

Compute 1/sqrt() using elimination.

a*scale*scale

x = 0.5

x = 0.5*x(3.0 - a*x*x)
