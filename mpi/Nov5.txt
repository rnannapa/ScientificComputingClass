# Inverse is done in two steps 
 1. Factorizing
 2. Forward and Backward substitution

stdio doesnt have executables
printf is in libc directory.
-lm math library is not in libc
.so shared object for executable. 
.a archive file
if both .a and .so are present it uses .so file to link.

Static link: Running a code that we are linking to is injected into the executable and can port the code around. The code becomes larger.

Dynamic linking: Linking at run time. Cant port the code.

on mac remove -lrt in the readme file of mpi to run

Put your installed software in /usr/local/

.so file in usr/local/bin

.h file in usr/local/include
